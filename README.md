### OWLJS BOILER PLATE

This project's main branch acts as a boiler plate to give an idea of how owl.js would be implemented
The dev branch would contain test code running on this starter project to test the functionalities of the owl.js library it'self which would be created an hosted in the npm registry
This app's dev branch would see to implement a social media application so as to encourage the owl.js development to cover a wide vierity and support
As for now, the boiler plate only supports implementation with mongodb's mongoose client
